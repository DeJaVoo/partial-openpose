# Partial OpenPose

The purpose of this project is to use OpenPose capabilities on partial human images.
One of prerequisite of OpenPose system is to have full body image since it reconstruct the skeleton based on body parts.

Our method is to wisely add the missing body part into the image and then run the OpenPose.
The result is then manipulated to show the skeleton on the original body.
